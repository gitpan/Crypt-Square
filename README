Crypt::Square
=============

Square is a 128-bit block cipher that accepts a 128-bit key. Designed
by Joan Daemen, Vincent Rijmen, and Lars Knudsen, Square is the
predecessor of Rijndael, aka the Advanced Encryption Standard.

BONUS

The C file, _square.c, is a standalone Square implementation. To
compile it, type:

        gcc -Wall -DLITTLE_ENDIAN _square.c

A new binary, a.out, will be created.

To run the binary, type:

        ./a.out

Note that this implementation has been rigged and tested only on the
Intel platform, and thus, it could give wrong results for non-Intel
processors.
